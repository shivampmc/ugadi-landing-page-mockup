      <h2>About Ugadi</h2>
      <div class="about-section">
        Ugadi is the New Year's Day for the States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
        and Karnataka in India. It is festively observed in these regions on the
        first day of the Hindu lunisolar calendar month of Chaitra. This
        typically falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar. <br />The
        day is observed by drawing colourful patterns on the floor called
        kolamulus ( Kannada: Rangoli, Telugu: Muggulu) mango leaf decorations on
        doors called torana (kannada: torana, Telugu: Toranalu), buying and
        giving gifts such as new clothes, giving charity to the poor, special
        bath followed by oil treatment, preparing and sharing a special food
        called pachadi, and visiting Hindu temples. The pachadi is a notable
        festive food that combines all flavors â€“ sweet, sour, salty, bitter,
        astringent and piquant (spicy hot). In Telugu and Kannada Hindu
        traditions, it is a symbolic reminder that one must expect all flavors
        of experiences in the coming new year and make the most of them.
